A simple node.js and express app where I practise socket.io.
Even though the example is single it was enough to have a 
better idea on it's workings. Adding other features such as 
private messages ("io.to(socket#id).emit('hey')" as simple as 
this) and connecting and saving all the messages to
the database could be imlemented but there isn't much left for 
me to learn here. So moving on...
