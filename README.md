A simple node.js and express app where I practise socket.io.
Even though the example is simple, it was enough to have a 
better idea on it's workings. Adding other features such as 
private messages and connecting and saving all the messages to
the database could be imlemented but there isn't much left for 
me to learn here. So moving on...
